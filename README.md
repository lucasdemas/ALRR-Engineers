# ALRR-Engineers Location Finder

## NOTE For First Iteration
After talking to our TA (who said it was fine), we decided to leave the client id out of the location table due to uncertainty of it in regards to what multi-client is representing (we will add this for the second iteration)

## API Endpoints
	* ___Clients___ (paths beginning with /client)
		* Get `/getAll`
			* This endpoint is used to retireve all of the clients that are stored in the database
			* It does not require any inputs at all
			* URL input: localhost:8080/client/getAll
	
		* Get `/get/{id}`
			* This endpoint will return a specific client's information if there is a client in the database with that id
			* Will throw an error if there is no client with the specified id
			* URL input: localhost:8080/client/get/{id}
			
		* Post `/add`
			* This endpoint will take the provided client name and email and create a new client in the database with the information
			* They will be automatically given a client id that is generated by the database
			* Required inputs:
				* `clientName` String
				* `clientEmail` String
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/client/add -d clientName="x" -d clientEmail="y"
				* Where x and y are the name and email of the client
			* This endpoint will also check to ensure that there is a client name and that the email provided is a proper email format
		
		* Post `/updateEmail`
			* This endpoint is used to update the email of a client given their client id and the updated email
			* This will check to make sure that the updated email is an actual email by checking it's formatting
			* Required inputs:
				* `clientId` Integer
				* `clientEmail` String
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/client/updateEmail -d clientId=x -d clientEmail="y"
				* Where x and y are the client's id and updated email provided
				
		* Post `/delete`
			* This endpoint will delete a client from the database if there is a client that exists with the id provided
			* This will check if a client does exist with the provided id and if not, it will throw an exception
			* Required input:
				* `clientId` Integer
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/client/delete -d clientId=x
				* Where x is the client id that is being deleted
	
	* ___Locations___ (paths beginning with /location)
		* Get `/getAll`
			* This endpoint is used to retireve all of the locations that are stored in the database
			* It does not require any inputs at all
			* URL input: localhost:8080/location/getAll
		
		* Get `/getClaim/{isClaim}`
			* This endpoint will return all locations that are either claimed or unclaimed based on the inputted value for isClaim
				* Can either be claimed or unclaimed
				* All other inputs will result in an exception being thrown
			* URL input: localhost:8080/location/getClaim/{isClaim}
			
		* Post `/add`
			* This endpoint will take the provided location name, area and cost and create a new location in the database with the information
			* They will be automatically given a location id that is generated by the database
			* Required inputs:
				* `locName` String
				* `locArea` String
				* `locCost` Double
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/location/add -d locationName="x" -d locationArea="y" -d locationCost=z
				* Where x and y are the name and area for the location
				* Z is the cost of the location
			* This endpoint will also check to ensure that the location name and area are valid and that the locationCost is a positive number
			
		* Post `/updateCost`
			* This endpoint is used to update the cost of a specific location
			* This will check to make sure that the updated cost is also a positive number and throw an exception otherwise
			* This will also check that there is an location with the provided location id in the database and throw an exception if it does not exist
			* Required inputs:
				* `locId` Integer
				* `locCost` Double
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/location/updateCost -d locId=x -d locCost=y
				* Where x and y is the location's id and the updated cost provided
				
		* Post `/updateClaim`
			* This endpoint is used to update the claim status of a specific location
			* This will check to make sure that the claim status provided is a boolean value (true or false) and throw an exception otherwise
			* This will also check that there is an location with the provided location id in the database and if it doesn't exist will throw an exception
			* Required inputs:
				* `locId` Integer
				* `locClaim` Boolean
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/location/updateClaim -d locId=x -d locClaim=y
				* Where x and y is the location's id and the claim status provided
				
		* Post `/delete`
			* This endpoint will delete a location from the database if there is a location that exists with the id provided
			* This will check if a location does exist with the provided id and if not, it will throw an exception
			* Required input:
				* `locId` Integer
			* To run in command line: curl localhost:8080/location/delete -d locId=x
				* Where x is the location id of the location that is being deleted
				
## Starting the Application
Go to the LocationFinder folder (/LocationFinder) and run the following command:
	`mvnw spring-boot:run` or `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (some team members needed to run the left for it to work and others had to run the right)
	* mvnw will install the most recent maven version so you do not need to install it yourself
	
	* After running this you can use another command terminal to do systems tests by running curl commands (like mentioned in the endpoints)

## Testing the Application
Go to the LocationFinder folder (/LocationFinder) and run the following command:
	`mvnw test` or `./mvnw test` (some team members needed to run the left for it to work and others had to run the right)
	
	* Running this will run all of the Unit tests in the test folder and output the results of the tests
	
## Style Checking
For this assignment we used checkstyle to clean up the code and take care of any issues

We get an output of the style erros by running the following command in the LocationFinder folder:
	`mvnw site` or `./mvnw site` (some team members needed to run the left for it to work and others had to run the right)
	
This generates a checkstyle html file in the LocationFinder/target/site folder that displays all of the style errors that are present

We have incorporated a checkstyle-supress.xml file to supress certain checks that had no effect on the execution of the code (for example removing the need to have a package-info file in each directory)
